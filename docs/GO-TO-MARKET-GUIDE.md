Show HN: How I saved $142K by replacing my team with AI agents
```

**Test these with friends, pick the one with best reaction**

**HN Post (First Comment Strategy):**

Immediately post first comment with context:

```
Hi HN! Solo developer here. I wanted to prove that one person + AI agents can compete
with funded teams, so I built this SmugMug API reference app in a weekend.

The twist: I didn't just use Copilot for autocomplete. I orchestrated 5 specialized AI
agents as a virtual development team‚Äîeach with distinct roles like feature building,
testing, code review, documentation, and DevOps.

Results:
- 20,000+ lines of production code
- Comprehensive testing (unit + E2E + runtime error detection)
- 78,000 words of documentation
- Total cost: $157 in API credits vs. $144K traditional approach

The repo includes a detailed case study documenting the workflow, prompt strategies,
what worked/didn't work, and a blueprint for other solo devs.

Would love feedback on the agent orchestration approach! GitHub: [link]
```

**Monitoring:**
- Check HN every 30 minutes
- Respond to all comments within 1 hour
- Be humble, helpful, and transparent

---

### Day 2 (cont.): Reddit Launch

**r/programming** (2-3 hours after HN)

**Title:**
```
I built an enterprise-grade app in 72 hours as a solo developer using AI agent orchestration
```

**Post Body:**
```
[Reuse HN post content, adjusted for Reddit tone]

Tech stack: React 19, TypeScript 5.8, Vite, Playwright, Gemini API

The most interesting part wasn't the app itself‚Äîit was the workflow. I managed AI agents
like a real team, each with specialized roles. The case study documenting this process
is in the repo.

Happy to answer questions about the approach!
```

**Other Subreddits (space out by 2-4 hours):**
- r/webdev
- r/reactjs
- r/typescript
- r/SideProject (if applicable)
- r/ArtificialIntelligence

---

### Day 3 (Wednesday): Twitter/X Thread

**Launch Time:** 9-11am (your timezone's peak engagement)

**Thread Structure (10-15 tweets):**

```
üßµ I built an enterprise-grade app in 72 hours as a solo developer.

Not with Copilot. With 5 specialized AI agents I orchestrated as a virtual team.

Here's how one person can now compete with funded engineering teams:

1/üßµ

---

Traditional approach to build this:
‚Ä¢ 4 senior engineers
‚Ä¢ 3 months of work
‚Ä¢ ~$144,000 in costs

My approach:
‚Ä¢ 1 solo developer (me)
‚Ä¢ 5 AI agents
‚Ä¢ 72 hours
‚Ä¢ $157 in API costs

98.8% cost reduction. 30x faster. Same quality.

2/üßµ

---

The secret: Don't use AI as autocomplete.
Use AI as a TEAM.

My team:
‚Ä¢ Agent 1: Feature builder (senior full-stack dev)
‚Ä¢ Agent 2: Testing specialist (QA engineer)
‚Ä¢ Agent 3: Code quality enforcer (tech lead)
‚Ä¢ Agent 4: Documentation (technical writer)
‚Ä¢ Agent 5: DevOps (CI/CD specialist)

3/üßµ

---

[Continue with 7-12 more tweets covering:]
- Day-by-day development log
- What worked / what didn't
- Prompt strategies
- Actual code stats (20K lines, 80% test coverage)
- Documentation (78K words, validated)
- Results and lessons learned

[Final tweet:]
The full case study with prompt templates, agent configs, and a complete workflow
blueprint is in the GitHub repo.

If you're a solo dev, this is your new playbook.

Subject: Solo dev who built enterprise app in 72 hours using AI agents

Hi [Host Name],

I'm [Your Name], a solo developer who recently built an enterprise-grade application
in 72 hours by orchestrating AI agents as a virtual development team.

The project demonstrates a new approach to solo development where AI agents take on
specialized roles (feature building, testing, code review, documentation, DevOps) rather
than just autocomplete.

Key talking points:
- 98.8% cost reduction ($144K ‚Üí $1.6K)
- 30x velocity improvement
- Detailed case study with metrics
- Implications for solo devs and the industry

The repo has 1,000+ GitHub stars and made the HN front page [if true by then].

Would this be a good fit for [Podcast Name]? Happy to provide more details.

Best,

## Sample Social Media Posts

### Twitter Hook Examples

**Hook 1 (Savings Angle):**
```
I just saved $142,000.

Not by cutting costs.

By replacing a 4-person team with AI agents.

Here's how one solo developer can now build enterprise-grade products:

üßµ
```

**Hook 2 (Time Angle):**
```
72 hours.

20,000 lines of production code.

Comprehensive testing.

78,000 words of documentation.

One developer. Five AI agents.

This is the future of solo development:

üßµ
```

**Hook 3 (Challenge Angle):**
```
Can one developer compete with a funded engineering team?

I tested this with a real project.

Built in 72 hours what traditionally takes 3 months and $144K.

The secret: AI agent orchestration.

Here's the full breakdown:

üßµ
```

### LinkedIn Post Example

```
üöÄ The Future of Solo Development is Here

I just built an enterprise-grade application in 72 hours. As a solo developer.

The approach: I orchestrated 5 specialized AI agents as a virtual development team.

Results:
‚Ä¢ 20,000+ lines of production code
‚Ä¢ Full test coverage (unit + E2E + runtime)
‚Ä¢ 78,000 words of documentation
‚Ä¢ $157 in costs (vs. $144K traditional)

This isn't about using Copilot for autocomplete. It's about managing AI agents like
you'd manage a real team‚Äîeach with distinct roles, responsibilities, and expertise.

The implications for software development are massive:
1. Solo developers can now build ambitious products
2. Startups can validate ideas without raising capital
3. The barrier to entry for complex projects has collapsed

I documented the entire workflow, including prompt strategies, agent configurations,
and lessons learned. The case study is open source on GitHub.

What does this mean for your team? For your career? For the industry?

I'd love to hear your thoughts. üëá

### Reddit Post Example (r/programming)

**Title:**
```
I built an enterprise-grade app in 72 hours by orchestrating AI agents as a virtual team
[Case Study]
```

**Body:**
```
Hey r/programming,

Solo developer here. I wanted to test whether one person + AI agents could compete with
a traditional engineering team, so I built a SmugMug API reference app over a weekend.

The twist: Instead of using AI as autocomplete, I orchestrated 5 specialized agents as a
virtual development team. Each agent had a distinct role:

- Agent 1: Feature implementation (full-stack dev)
- Agent 2: Testing (QA engineer)
- Agent 3: Code review (tech lead)
- Agent 4: Documentation (technical writer)
- Agent 5: CI/CD (DevOps)

Results:
- 20,000+ lines of React/TypeScript code
- 80%+ test coverage (unit + E2E + runtime error detection)
- 78,000 words of validated documentation
- 72 hours of work
- $157 in API costs

Traditional approach would have been:
- 4 senior engineers
- 3 months of work
- ~$144,000 in costs

The repo includes a detailed case study documenting:
- Day-by-day development log
- Agent orchestration workflow
- Prompt strategies and templates
- What worked and what didn't
- ROI analysis

Tech stack: React 19, TypeScript 5.8, Vite, Playwright, Google Gemini API

I'm sharing this because I think it demonstrates a new approach to solo development that
other developers can learn from. The barrier to building ambitious projects has collapsed.

Happy to answer questions about the workflow, costs, prompt engineering, or anything else!
