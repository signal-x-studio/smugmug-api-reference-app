# GitHub Pages Configuration Options

## 🎯 **Current Issue**
GitHub Actions workflow is failing due to deprecated action versions and Pages may not be configured correctly.

## 🔧 **Two Deployment Options**

### **Option 1: GitHub Actions Deployment (Recommended)**
**Best for**: Dynamic builds, modern CI/CD, automatic deployment

**Steps to Enable**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/signal-x-studio/smugmug-api-reference-app/settings/pages
2. Set **Source** to: "GitHub Actions"
3. The workflow will handle the rest automatically

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Automatic deployment on every push
- ✅ Build optimization and caching
- ✅ Modern CI/CD best practices
- ✅ No manual build steps required

### **Option 2: Deploy from Branch (Fallback)**
**Best for**: Simple static sites, when Actions are restricted

**Steps to Enable**:
1. Build locally: `cd docs-site && npm run build`
2. Copy `docs-site/build/*` to `docs/` folder in root
3. Go to: https://github.com/signal-x-studio/smugmug-api-reference-app/settings/pages
4. Set **Source** to: "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose **Branch**: "main" and **Folder**: "/docs"

**Drawbacks**:
- ❌ Manual deployment required
- ❌ Build artifacts committed to repo
- ❌ No automatic optimization

## 🚀 **Recommended: Fix Actions Deployment**

I've updated the workflow file to use the latest action versions:
- `actions/configure-pages@v4` (was v3)
- `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` (was v2)  
- `actions/deploy-pages@v4` (was v2)

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Enable GitHub Pages with Actions**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/signal-x-studio/smugmug-api-reference-app/settings/pages
   - Set Source: "GitHub Actions"

2. **Commit the Fixed Workflow**:
   - Updated workflow will deploy automatically
   - Site will be available at: https://signal-x-studio.github.io/smugmug-api-reference-app/

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check: https://github.com/signal-x-studio/smugmug-api-reference-app/actions
   - Monitor build progress and deployment success

## 🎯 **Expected Result**
After enabling GitHub Actions as the source, the workflow will:
1. ✅ Build the Docusaurus site
2. ✅ Optimize assets and generate static files  
3. ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages automatically
4. ✅ Site accessible at the GitHub Pages URL

The GitHub Actions approach is strongly recommended as it provides modern CI/CD capabilities and requires no manual intervention.
