# 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX: GitHub Pages 404 Issue

## 🔍 **Root Cause Found**
1. **Node.js Version**: GitHub Actions workflow using Node 18, but Docusaurus requires Node 20+
2. **Build Failures**: All Actions workflows failing due to version mismatch
3. **Deployment Source**: GitHub Pages confused between Actions vs manual deployment

## ⚡ **QUICK FIX (2 minutes)**

### **Option A: Use Manual Deployment (Immediate)**
The site files are already built in the `/docs` folder, but GitHub Pages needs to be configured correctly.

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/signal-x-studio/smugmug-api-reference-app/settings/pages
2. **Source**: Change from "GitHub Actions" to "Deploy from a branch"  
3. **Branch**: Select "main"
4. **Folder**: Select "/docs" 
5. **Click "Save"**

**Result**: Site will be live in 1-2 minutes at https://signal-x-studio.github.io/smugmug-api-reference-app/

### **Option B: Wait for Actions Fix (5-10 minutes)**
I've just pushed a fix changing Node.js from v18 to v20 in the workflow. 

**Steps:**
1. Keep GitHub Pages set to "GitHub Actions" 
2. Wait for the current workflow run to complete
3. Site will deploy automatically

## 🎯 **Recommended: Use Option A Now**

Since you need the site working immediately, I recommend:

1. **Switch to branch deployment** (Option A) to get the site live now
2. **Keep the Actions workflow** for future automatic deployments
3. **Test the site** to ensure everything works
4. **Optionally switch back** to Actions once the Node.js fix is confirmed working

## 📋 **What the Manual Deployment Contains**

The `/docs` folder already has:
- ✅ Complete Docusaurus build with all pages
- ✅ Interactive components (API demo, workflow visualization)  
- ✅ Responsive design and navigation
- ✅ All documentation content we created
- ✅ Optimized assets and SEO

## 🚀 **Expected Result**

After switching to branch deployment, you'll have:
- **Working site** at https://signal-x-studio.github.io/smugmug-api-reference-app/
- **Interactive documentation** with copy-paste examples
- **Multi-agent workflow demo** with step-by-step visualization
- **API schema demo** with live input/output
- **Professional presentation** ready for sharing

The site content is complete and ready - it just needs the right deployment configuration!
