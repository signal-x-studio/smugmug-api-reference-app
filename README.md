## üöÄ Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd smugmug-api-reference-app
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key" > .env
   ```

3. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Explore the Application**
   - Visit `http://localhost:5173`
   - Use the mock authentication (development mode)
   - Try AI photo analysis features
   - Explore batch processing workflows

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Service Layer Pattern
```typescript
// Clean abstraction for API complexity
interface SmugMugService {
  authenticate(): Promise<SmugMugCredentials>;
  fetchUserTree(): Promise<SmugMugNode[]>;
  updatePhotoMetadata(photo: Photo, metadata: AiData): Promise<void>;
}
```

### AI Integration Excellence  
```typescript
// Structured AI responses for enterprise reliability
const metadataSchema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    title: { type: "string", maxLength: 100 },
    description: { type: "string", maxLength: 500 },
    keywords: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" }, maxItems: 20 }
  },
  required: ["title", "description", "keywords"]
};
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow Coordination
- **GitHub Copilot**: Real-time code completion and boilerplate generation
