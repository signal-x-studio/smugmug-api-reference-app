> **Built in 72 hours by one developer + five AI agents**
>
> This isn't just a reference appâ€”it's proof that solo developers can build enterprise-grade products by orchestrating AI agents as a virtual team.

## The Story

**Traditional approach:** 4 developers Ã— 3 months = $144,000
**This approach:** 1 developer Ã— 3 days + AI agents = $1,657 (98.8% cost reduction)

I didn't use AI to code faster. I **orchestrated specialized AI agents as a development team**, each with distinct roles: feature building, testing, code review, documentation, and DevOps.

**The result:** 20,000+ lines of production code, comprehensive testing, 78,000 words of documentationâ€”in a weekend.

## Three Pillars of AI-Native Development

1.  **Building WITH AI**: Multi-agent workflow where each agent specializes (like hiring a team)
2.  **Building AI INTO Features**: Semantic photo search powered by Google Gemini
3.  **Building FOR AI**: Agent-native architecture with dual human/machine interfaces

## Core Features

-   **AI-Powered Photo Search**: Natural language search for photo discovery.
-   **Bulk Operations**: A virtualized interface for selecting and managing thousands of photos.
-   **SmugMug API Integration**: A complete reference implementation for OAuth 1.0a authentication.
-   **Agent-Native Design**: Components are built with a dual interface for both UI and programmatic control.
-   **AI-Enforced Architecture**: A portable subagent framework enforces project-specific coding standards.

## Live Demo

You can try the application live at: **[https://signal-x-studio.github.io/smugmug-api-reference-app/](https://signal-x-studio.github.io/smugmug-api-reference-app/)**

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/signal-x-studio/smugmug-api-reference-app.git
cd smugmug-api-reference-app

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables (optional)
# The app will use mock data if no API keys are provided.
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
