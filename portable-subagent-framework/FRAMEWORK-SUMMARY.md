## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### 1. **Tech Stack Agnostic**
- Works with React, Vue, Python, Node.js, Java, C#, Go, Rust, etc.
- Configurable rule engine adapts to any language or framework
- Extensible template system for new tech stacks

### 2. **Portable & Self-Contained**
- Zero external dependencies on host project
- Complete framework in single directory
- Easy to copy between projects or distribute as package
- Can be version controlled separately

### 3. **AI Tool Compatible**
Works seamlessly with all major AI coding assistants:
- **GitHub Copilot**: `@ProjectSubagent validate this component`
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: `@ProjectGuardian check architecture compliance`
- **Cursor IDE**: Real-time validation during development
- **Gemini Code Assist**: Natural language command processing
- **Any AI tool**: Accepts custom instructions and validation patterns

### 4. **Proven Architecture Standards**
Based on battle-tested patterns from SmugMug Photo Discovery project:
- Component size limits (≤200 lines)
- Hook complexity constraints (≤3 dependencies per useEffect)
- Type safety enforcement (zero `any` types)
- Memory leak prevention (required cleanup functions)
- Performance optimization (mandatory memoization)
- Agent-native capabilities (dual-interface architecture)

## 📋 Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Quick Project Setup
```bash
# Copy framework to your project
cp -r portable-subagent-framework ./subagent-framework

# Generate project-specific subagent
cd subagent-framework
node generators/create-subagent.js --interactive

# Use immediately
cd ..
node my-project-subagent.cjs test
```

### Pattern 2: Organization-Wide Standards
```bash
# Create organization template
git clone portable-subagent-framework acme-corp-standards

# Customize for organization
node generators/create-subagent.js \
  --organization="ACME Corp" \
  --standards="enterprise,security,accessibility"

# Teams reference centralized standards
git submodule add https://github.com/acme-corp/acme-corp-standards.git standards
```

### Pattern 3: NPM Package Distribution
```bash
# Package for distribution
npm publish @acme-corp/subagent-framework

# Teams install and use
npm install -D @acme-corp/subagent-framework
npx create-subagent --tech-stack=react-typescript
```

## 🎨 Template Showcase

### React/TypeScript Template

- **Performance**: Memoization requirements, bundle size limits
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript, explicit interfaces
- **Agent Integration**: Dual-interface patterns, Schema.org markup
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup functions, AbortController usage

### Python FastAPI Template  
- **Function Architecture**: Parameter limits, complexity constraints
- **Type Safety**: Required type hints, return type annotations
- **Async Patterns**: Proper async/await usage, exception handling
- **Performance**: Database optimization, connection pooling
- **Security**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention

### Generic Template
- **Universal Rules**: File size, function complexity, nesting depth
- **Maintainability**: Descriptive naming, documentation requirements
- **Performance**: Algorithm efficiency, memory management
- **Language Agnostic**: Works with any programming language
