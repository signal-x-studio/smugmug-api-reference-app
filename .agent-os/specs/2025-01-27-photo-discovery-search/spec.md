> Spec: Photo Discovery & Search - Agent-queryable photo collections
> Created: 2025-01-27

## Overview

Implement semantic search and natural language query processing for photo collections to enable browser agents and users to discover photos through conversational commands. This feature establishes the foundation for agent-native photo management by making all photo metadata searchable and actionable through structured queries.

## User Stories

### Agent-Powered Photo Discovery

As a user with browser AI agents, I want to search for photos using natural language queries like "show me sunset photos from my Europe trip", so that I can quickly find specific photos without manually browsing through albums.

**Detailed Workflow:** User speaks or types natural language query → Agent parses intent and parameters → System translates to structured search → Results displayed with agent-actionable metadata → User can refine query or perform bulk operations on results.

### Smart Photo Collection Management

As a photographer managing large photo collections, I want to filter and sort photos using semantic criteria combined with metadata filters, so that I can efficiently organize and curate my work for client presentations.

**Detailed Workflow:** User accesses advanced search interface → Applies combination of semantic filters (people, objects, scenes) and metadata filters (date, camera, location) → Results update in real-time → Bulk selection tools enable rapid organization operations.

### Agent-Coordinated Bulk Operations

As a user working with browser agents, I want agents to perform bulk operations on search results through natural language commands, so that complex multi-step photo management workflows can be automated.

**Detailed Workflow:** User performs search query → Agent presents actionable results → User requests bulk operation ("add these to new album called Summer 2024") → Agent coordinates operation with user confirmation → Results processed and confirmed.

## Spec Scope

1. **Natural Language Query Parser** - Process conversational search queries and extract search parameters, intent, and context
2. **Semantic Search Engine** - Search photos using AI-generated metadata, keywords, and visual content analysis
3. **Advanced Filter Interface** - Combine semantic searches with traditional metadata filters (date, camera, location, etc.)
4. **Agent-Ready Search Results** - Display results with structured data and actionable elements for agent interaction
5. **Bulk Selection & Operations** - Enable mass selection and operations on search results through both UI and agent commands

## Out of Scope

- Visual similarity search (finding photos that look similar to a reference image)
- Advanced AI training or custom model development beyond existing metadata
- Real-time photo analysis during search (relies on pre-generated metadata)
- Cross-platform search integration with external services
- Advanced analytics or search performance optimization

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Search Interface** - Users can search photos using natural language queries with results displayed in under 3 seconds
2. **Agent Integration** - Browser agents can execute search queries and bulk operations programmatically through structured data exposure
3. **Comprehensive Filtering** - All photo metadata fields are searchable and filterable with real-time result updates
