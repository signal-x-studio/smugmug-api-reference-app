> Spec: Agent-Native Architecture Implementation
> Created: 2025-09-27

## Overview

Implement agent-ready architecture patterns that enable seamless interaction between human users and AI agents (browser agents like Gemini-in-Chrome, OS agents, and third-party AI assistants). This transformation positions our application as a pioneering example of agent-native web development, establishing first-mover advantage in the emerging agent-web interaction paradigm.

## User Stories

### Browser Agent Integration

As a **user with Gemini-in-Chrome**, I want to **interact with the photo management application using natural language commands**, so that **I can efficiently manage my photo collection without manual UI navigation**.

The user can say "Find all sunset photos from my Europe trip" and the browser agent will discover the application's search capabilities, parse the natural language query, execute the appropriate filters, and present the results. The agent can also perform batch operations like "Generate metadata for all photos in this album" through programmatic interaction with the application's AI services.

### Developer Agent Integration  

As a **developer building agent-native applications**, I want to **see working examples of dual-interface architecture**, so that **I can implement similar patterns in my own projects**.

The developer can examine our structured data implementation, agent action registry patterns, and natural language API design to understand how to build applications that work seamlessly for both human users and AI agents. They get copy-paste code examples and architectural patterns they can adapt.

### Cross-Agent Workflow Coordination

As a **photographer using multiple AI tools**, I want **different agents to coordinate photo management workflows**, so that **I can leverage specialized capabilities without manual data transfer**.

A browser agent can identify photos needing analysis, hand off to our application's AI agent for metadata generation, then coordinate with external agents for advanced processing, with all agents sharing structured data and maintaining workflow context.

## Spec Scope

1. **Structured Data Layer** - Add Schema.org markup and JSON-LD to all React components for machine readability
2. **Agent State Registry** - Expose React application state through standardized global interface accessible to browser agents  
3. **Agent Action Registry** - Complete inventory of programmatic equivalents for all UI functionality with parameter schemas
4. **Natural Language API** - Parse voice/text commands and translate to structured application actions with confidence scoring
5. **Agent Performance Optimization** - Ensure sub-second response times for agent interactions with caching and async execution
6. **Documentation Architecture Update** - Update Docusaurus site, README, and related documentation to showcase agent-native capabilities as a key architecture spoke
7. **Interactive Agent Examples** - Add live demonstrations of agent interaction patterns to the documentation site

## Out of Scope

- Full conversational AI implementation (multi-turn conversations)
- Advanced machine learning for intent classification (using simple pattern matching initially)
- Integration with specific third-party agent platforms beyond browser agents
- Automated agent workflow orchestration (manual handoffs initially)
- Agent-specific UI themes or visual adaptations

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Browser Agent Compatibility** - Gemini-in-Chrome can discover and execute 100% of application functionality through structured data and action registry
2. **Natural Language Processing** - Voice/text commands like "Find sunset photos" successfully parse and execute with >80% accuracy
3. **Performance Validation** - All agent interactions complete within 1-second response time with no degradation to human user experience
4. **Documentation Leadership** - Updated Docusaurus site becomes the definitive reference for agent-native web development with interactive examples
5. **Developer Adoption** - Complete implementation guide and interactive examples enable other developers to implement agent-native patterns
6. **README Evolution** - Project README positions agent-native architecture as core differentiator alongside multi-agent development workflow
